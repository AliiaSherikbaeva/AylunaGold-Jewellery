Welcome to Ayluna Gold — a modern, full-stack e-commerce platform built to support and empower small and medium-sized jewelry businesses. This project was created as part of my diploma thesis and was inspired by my family’s experience running a traditional jewelry store in Central Asian cities like Almaty, Bishkek, and Osh.
